# A simple yeast converter webpage
* Convert yeast types and measurements into your chosen ones
* Useful when the internet uses stupid units, or a type not readily available to you

## Why?
* Possibly the same reason you're here (to bake bread)
* Existing yeast calculators left a lot to be desired (a sentence I never thought I'd write)
  * Finnicky to choose options from a single huge list (the two variables were not separated)
  * Some bugs in the conversion ratios, probably due to their manual calculation and being populated in a pre-defined list
